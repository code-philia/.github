## Welcome to CoPhi Group in SJTU 👋

CoPhi group is a research group on software engineering and security in the Department of Computer Science, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, with close collaboration with School of Computing, National University of Singapore. 
Our research focus lies as follows:

- Software Causality and Explanation

We develop technique and tools to trace the root cause of some software behaviors such as software bugs and anomaly.
Specifically, we automate the software debugging and log analysis technique to help people to understand the program behaviors and make more informed decision.
It is important for people to understand the execution in the era of LLM and AIGC.

- Trustworthy Code Generation

We generate trustworthy code include generating general code and their test cases.
  
- Visualized and Explainable Model Development

We help the people understand the learned representation space of deep learning models by converting the training process into an interactble animation. 
Model developers can understand how the representation space evolves during the training.
Further, we support query and interactive recommendation for the developers to locate the most important training events.

- Scam and Phishing Detection

We develop explainable AI solution for security engineers and users to identify phishing webpages and emails.
